This repo will host different versions of a slide deck to be presented at an upcoming retreat.  Each version will represent different composition approaches including pure person-derived, ai-derived, and hybrid.  The presentation is a 5-7 minutes lightning talk outlining my experience with collaboratively creating video modules in support of teaching reproducible research practices.  The talk will be given at the Duke University Libraries _Teaching & Learning Retreat_ on April 3, 2020.

The details of the workshop are as follows:

On April 3rd.  [DUL](https://library.duke.edu) will host a Teaching & Learning Retreat with keynote speaker, Rebecca Miller Waltz, https://bit.ly/3TRRKVb, who will kick off the event with a presentation, Defining, Creating, and Engaging in Instructional Space at Duke University Libraries.

Following the keynote, weâ€™ll have lightning talks from staff across the libraries, discussions on trending topics, and a delicious lunch to close out the day. (To save the date to your Outlook calendar, a meeting invitation is attached.)

## process

I used suggestions about prompt engineering to ply three LLMs:  copilot.microsoft.com ; claude.ai ; gemini.google.com.  Prompt enginnering advice came from the April 2, 2024 episode:  [How Should I Be Using A.I. Right Now?](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/02/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-ethan-mollick.html). summarizing the process the goal is to identify and audience and a role; describe the talk goal, request slide titles, then requrest details for each slide.   Each LLM operated differently.  In the end I used a combination of human composition augmented with selections from each LLM.  You can view my [informal scoring](score_informal.qmd)
